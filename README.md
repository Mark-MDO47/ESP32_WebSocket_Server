# ESP32_WebSocket_Server
Experimentation based on https://randomnerdtutorials.com ESP32 tutorials.

## I do not know exactly what license to put on this
I could not find anything on https://randomnerdtutorials.com that stated under what terms it was OK to use their freely available tutorials.

I presume that tutorials that are available for anyone for free on the internet will not contain intellectual property that I shouldn't post on GitHub.

I have also purchased some of their books including "Build Web Servers with ESP32 and ESP8266" V2.1 and did not find any license or usage information using a word search.

I think it is respectful and intellectually honest to provide attribution to https://randomnerdtutorials.com when using their published code.

## My further development

All my changes and/or additions to the https://randomnerdtutorials.com published code is governed by the "unlicense", normally provided by https://unlicense.org.

Curiously on 2023-07-21 I am getting returns from my browsers that make me think that there is a problem with either the https protocol used by unlicense.org or else a conflict between the DNS records and Cloudflare network. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.
